                        This project was built for a univesity course. It is a Swing based desktop application written in Scala, and it can be used to simulate different objects and their movements in space, e.g. planets, stars, satellites etc. The simulation is visualised and the different parametres can be tweaked. A more detailed project document is availabe in the source repository.

                        This very simple Android app was built to control the movements of a small four-wheeled robot, as part of a high school introductory electronics course. The choice of project idea was quite free and guidance was minimal. Our project was done in a group of three, and I was responsible for making the app.

                        This was a long project among a couple friends, where I was responsible for modding our Minecraft gaming server by writing plugins for the Bukkit/Spigot server platform with Java. The snippet below is from a quest system that allows server administators to build their own storylines for their players to explore. Since then, I have learned even more about e.g. writing cleaner and more understandable code.
